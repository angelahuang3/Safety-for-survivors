# hack4humanity
Our initiative stemmed from the February 2023 Turkey earthquake, aiming to create a safety platform (SOS) for victims seeking assistance. Volunteers can access location information through our integrated Google Map feature, enabling swift rescue responses. Real-time notifications alert victims when help is on the way.

The project utilized **Python Flask** for backend logic, **PostgreSQL** for the database, and a **React** app for the frontend. Seamless integration of Google Maps enhances our platform's functionality.
